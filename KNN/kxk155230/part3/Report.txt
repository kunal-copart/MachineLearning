part3 contains the all the files 

You need to reach to  part3 in directory  path to run and compile the program.

Compile the file:

javac ImageClust.java

To Run the file :

java ImageClust images 3 clusteredImages\


I have used K-means clustering using RGB value of the image.

I assign the RGB value of each pixel to cluster .

It will contain the combination of all the cluster but you can see that all the different cluster have the same
RGB value.
